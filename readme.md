# Problem Statement

You have been given a dataset of customer orders from an online store. The data is in a CSV file `orders.csv` with the following columns:

- `order_id`: Unique identifier for each order
- `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer
- `order_date`: Date when the order was placed
- `product_id`: Unique identifier for each product
- `product_name`: Name of the product
- `product_price`: Price of the product
- `quantity`: Quantity of the product ordered

Your task is to write a Python program that performs the following tasks:

1. **Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.**
2. **Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.**
3. **Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset.**
4. **Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.**



# My Task

**My Task** is a containerized application designed for processing and analyzing revenue data from a CSV file. It provides details on:

- Monthly revenue
- Product revenue
- Customer revenue
- Top customers based on spending

The application is built using Docker to ensure a consistent development and testing environment.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
- **Docker Compose**: For managing multi-container Docker applications.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

### Build Docker Images

```sh
docker-compose build
```

### Running the Application
To start the application:
```sh
docker-compose up app
```

### Running Tests
To run tests:
```sh
docker-compose up test
```
This command builds and starts the test container, running your test suite.

### Stopping and Cleaning Up
When finished, stop and remove all containers:
``` sh
docker-compose down
```
Cleans up containers defined in docker-compose.yml.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
- **Docker Daemon Issues:** Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
- **Permission Problems:** Run Docker commands as administrator or adjust permissions.
- **Build Failures:** Check Dockerfile for correct dependencies.


## Key Files
- **Dockerfile:** Defines the application image build.
- **Dockerfile.test:** Defines the test image build.
- **docker-compose.yml:** Docker Compose configuration.
- **requirements.txt:** Lists Python packages needed for the app.
app.py: Contains the main application logic.
test_app.py: Contains the test cases for the application.
